Features

The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - C.
Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
Each source code is atomic using standard C library libc and no external libraries are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
Source codes are compiled and tested for every commit on the latest versions of three major operating systems viz., Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu (Linux) using MSVC 16 2019, AppleClang 11.0 and GNU 7.5.0 respectively.
Strict adherence to C11 standard ensures portability of code to embedded systems as well like ESP32, ARM Cortex, etc. with little to no changes.
Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.
Modular implementations and OpenSource licensing enable the functions to be utilized conveniently in other applications.
